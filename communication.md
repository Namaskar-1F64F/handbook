# Porter Finance Communication

We're an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world. We hire great people regardless of where they live, but with Porter Finance team members across more than 60 countries, it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, merge requests, and Slack channels.

We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down. When we go back and forth three times, we jump on a synchronous video call.

We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

## Coda.io

Never use a Coda.io / Presentations for something non-confidential that has to end up on the website or the handbook. Work on these edits via commits to a merge request. Then link to the merge request or diff to present the change to people. This prevents a duplication of effort and/or an out of date handbook.

### Link Sharing

If you do need a Coda.io Doc, create one with your company Coda.io account and set the visibility and access controls according to the following guidelines.

The recommended defaults when sharing a document for Porter Finance internal purposes is setting visibility to On - Porter Finance and access to Can Edit to ensure everyone can contribute!
