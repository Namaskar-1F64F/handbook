# Project Management
We follow a lightweight ceremoniless agile framework called [Flights](https://simonhoiberg.medium.com/the-flight-manual-9e1aedd04fbf).

## Feedback 
Feedback and opportunity areas should be shared continuously. Team members are also encouraged to share feedback at the conclusion of a flight.

## Stand up
We have daily async standups on discord facilitated by a discord bot.
