# Jordan Alexander Meyer
## Bio
I grew up in Barrington which is a suburb outside of Chicago, Illinois in the USA. I have 3 brothers, one older, two younger. I went to college at the University of Illinois where I studied Biomolecular Engineering. My senior year I realized I was much more interested in coding than I was my own major which led to me spending most of my time working on coding projects and leetcoding. Those efforts landed me a software engineering internship at Zillow in San Francisco which turned into a full-time role. After the pandemic hit, I moved to Austin where I met Russell Ratcliffe. I flipped a house (1712 Whitney Way, Austin, TX 78741) and then moved back to San Francisco to join a crypto startup focusing on empowering student athletes. After they pivoted away from crypto, I left and started Porter.

## How I got into crypto
In 2017, during the crypto bull market, my brother Christian and I set up an Ethereum mining facility in rural Iowa. We've been securing the network ever since. In 2020, during DeFi Summer, was when I became more interested in the dapps being built on the network and went down the DeFi rabbit hole.

## Personality
My most recent Myers Briggs test is ESTJ. I've noticed my personality shapes to who I must be to accomplish what I want. For example, I used to test as a INTJ when I was an engineer.
