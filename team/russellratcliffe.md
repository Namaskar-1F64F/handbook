Hereâ€™s a brief introduction on how I work and what I value. Hopefully this helps as a base framework for growing our relationship :)  
 
## Core Values ([https://jamesclear.com/core-values](https://jamesclear.com/core-values)) 

* Growth
* [Results](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results)
* [Efficiency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency)
* [Transparency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency)  

## Working Style 

* I prefer async-first communication - Pretty much all my working preferences are outlined in [Gitlabs Remote Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#introduction-to-asynchronous-communication)
* I like to work with a 2x [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) technique (50 min focused working, 10 min break/discord). I usually use [focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/)
* I believe in transparency, honesty and assuming best intent - I ask the same from others

## Books that have shaped my thinking 

* [80000 hours](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/) - how I think about making a positive impact on the world
* [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) - Big fan of [choice architecture](https://jamesclear.com/choice-architecture) & [systems over goals](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)
* [How To Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_To_Fail_at_Almost_Everything_and_Still_Win_Big) - Goals vs Systems, The Selfishness Illusion
