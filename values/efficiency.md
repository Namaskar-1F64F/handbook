## Efficiency

Working efficiently on the right things enables us to make fast progress, which makes our work more fulfilling.

**Write things down**

We document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues. We do that because ["the faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory."](https://www.quora.com/What-does-The-faintest-pencil-is-better-than-the-sharpest-memory-mean) It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it.

**Boring solutions**

Use the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that [“boring”](http://boringtechnology.club/) should [not be conflated with “bad” or “technical debt](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology).” The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun; using established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.

**Self-service and self-learning**

Team members should first [search for their own answers](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/) and, if an answer is not readily found or the answer is not clear, ask in public as we all should have a [low level of shame](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame). [Write down any new information discovered](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#write-things-down) and pay it forward so that those coming after will have better efficiency built on top of practicing collaboration, inclusion, and documenting the results.

**Be respectful of others' time**

Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.

**Frugality**

[Amazon states it best](http://www.amazon.jobs/principles) with: "Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense."

**Short verbal answers**

Give short answers to verbal questions so the other party has the opportunity to ask more or move on.

**Keep broadcasts short**

Keep one-to-many written communication short, as mentioned in [this HBR study](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-writing-is-destroying-your-companys-productivity): "A majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it’s too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise."

**Managers of one**

We want each team member to be a [manager of one](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one) who doesn't need daily check-ins to achieve their goals.

**Freedom and responsibility over rigidity**

When possible, we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes. You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. Freedom and responsibility are more efficient than rigidly following a process, or [creating interdependencies](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#product-groups), because they enable faster decision velocity and higher rates of [iteration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration).

**Accept mistakes**

Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one.

**Embrace change**

Adoption of features, user requirements, and the competitive landscape change frequently and rapidly. The most successful companies adapt their roadmap and their organization quickly to keep pace. One of the things that makes this challenging is the impact on our team. People may need to change teams, subject matter, or even who manages them. This can rightly feel disruptive. If we coach ourselves to embrace the positive aspects of change, such as increased opportunity and new things to learn, we can move faster as a company and increase our odds of success.
