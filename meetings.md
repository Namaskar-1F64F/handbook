# Meetings

We follow [gitlab meeting standards](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/).

## Key points

### Roles

Every meeting should have the following roles:

- Owner
  - Creates agenda
  - Responsible for electing a scribe
  - Records meeting
  - Runs meeting
- Scribe
  - Takes notes during meeting
  - Distills notes into a PR after meeting
- Others
  - Aid scribe in note-taking
  - Speak up if something is missed or needs repeating

### Meeting attendance is optional

We [do not look to a meeting by default](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#question-every-meeting); when they are necessary, we strive to make in-person attendance optional by enabling asynchronous contribution.

### No agenda, no attenda.

Always have an [agenda prepped and ready to go](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/), with the exception of [coffee chats](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats). Share this with your audience. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if thereâ€™s anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring.

### Document everything live (yes, everything)

It's not rude to focus on documentation in a meeting. A surefire way to waste time in a meeting is to avoid writing anything down. Meetings within an all-remote company require documentation to be worthwhile.

- During the meeting, add input and feedback from attendees to existing agenda items.
- When referencing a team member's name in the meeting agenda, ensure that both the first and last names are displayed. (e.g: When we write the name of the person who is speaking in the agenda, we should write the first and last name or use the tagging feature as a prefix)
- For action items, we go directly to a Github issue or merge request. This creates a direct takeaway from the meeting, where ideas are summarized and action can begin immediately.
- For optional attendees, or key team members who could not attend the meeting live, tagging them in the resulting GitLab issue(s) enables them to get themselves up to speed and contribute when it is suitable for their schedule.
- Record the meeting. You can always delete an unwanted meeting, but you cannot turn back the clock and record a meeting retroactively. This is particularly important if you want to present or wish to have a written transcription of the meeting.

### Avoid hybrid calls

A hybrid call is one that has a mix of participants in the same physical room, together with others who are remote. Hybrid calls should be avoided, as it's better to have everyone on a level playing field for communication and discussion. If a hybrid call must happen, however, everyone should use their own equipment (camera, headset, screen) even if they are physically sitting in the same room. This ensures that everyone is on the same playing field in terms of call experience. If possible, it's best to separate briefly for the call and find your own workspace, creating a 100% remote call. This helps avoid audio problems from delays and feedback.
