## Introduction
The Porter handbook is the central repository for how we operate as a team. Please make a merge request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.

### Gitlab Values & Standards
As a young organization, it is practical to start with the values and working standards of an organization we respect and alter them as necessary. We've decided to use Gitlab's values and standards because we align with them and they are made publicly available.  

If a working standard can't be found in this handbook, refer to the [Gitlab handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) or Google "DESIRED_TOPIC" + "gitlab".
